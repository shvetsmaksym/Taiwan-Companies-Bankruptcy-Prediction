# Bankruptcy Prediction

## Data
The dataset consists of:
* independent variables: financial indicators (~95) for selected Taiwan Companies (~6800)
* label: information whether company went bankrupt or not.

## Source
Data comes from the Taiwan Economic Journal including period of 1999â€“2009.

## Task
* To build a preprocessing pipeline, that will overcome the challenges with the data
* Find an appropriate classifier (ML models with different setups of hyperparameters) for bankruptcy prediction

## Challenges
* Low data quality (irrelevant data in some columns, highly correlated columns)
* Unbalanced data (classes distribution is ~1/30)

## Progress
1. Data preprocessing
2. Oversampling
