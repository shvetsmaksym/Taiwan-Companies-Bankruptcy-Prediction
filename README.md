## Task
* Build an optimal classifier for bankruptcy prediction.

## Challenges
* Low data quality (irrelevant data in some columns, highly correlated columns)
* Unbalanced data (classes distribution is ~1/30)

## Pipeline
1. Data exploration
2. Data preprocessing (data cleaning, remove correlated columns, oversampling)
